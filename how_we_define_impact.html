<h3>How We Define "People of Impact"</h3>

<p>We select all the authors who are involved in the development of the top 50 package. If one author is involved in the development of one package, his or her "impact" would be 1; if he or she is involved in the developement of six packages, his or her "impact" is 6.</p>

<p>Here we only give the top 10 R package authors.</p>
